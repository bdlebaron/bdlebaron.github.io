<H3>Evolution and Time Horizons in an Agent Based Stock Market</H3>
<H4>Blake LeBaron<BR>Graduate School of International Economics and

<P>This paper presents initial results from a new agent based
artificial stock market. The market is populated with heterogeneous
boundedly rational agents maximizing lifetime utility. Heterogeneity
is introduced through the agents' perception of the past, or memory.
They each view the market in different ways in terms of how much past
price data is useful for decision making. Long horizon agents, using
information from the distant past, compete with short horizon agents
in an evolutionary struggle endogenously driving the price of an
asset paying a risky dividend. Selection removes agents with less
wealth over time. Trading strategies are determined by a common set
of fixed rules loosely modeling mutual fund managers, or investment
newsletters. The managers recommend a dynamic allocation between
equity and cash given past information. Managers also evolve over
time, and only survive when they have customers following their
investment advice.   The selection of advisors allows for some
pooling of strategy information across traders.  It also makes the
ability to trade an endogenous feature of the market since it is
easier to find someone to trade with when heterogeneity is larger and
strategy use is more diverse.</P>
<P>The market setup has a well defined homogeneous rational
expectations equilibrium. It is shown that restricting strategies to
be long horizon enables convergence to this equilibrium where agents
agree on the appropriate pricing function, and trading volume goes to
zero. Allowing a broad range of trader horizons to enter the market
stops this convergence, and causes the market to converge to
something that more closely resembles real markets with high trading
volume, price volatility well above what it should be due to
fundamentals, fat tailed return distributions, and persistence in
both volume and volatility.</P>
<P>Experiments are performed to explore situations that might drive
the market to the homogenous equilibrium. Implementing a transaction
cost for changing strategies slows down the exploration of the
individual agents enough for the market to converge. Also, seeding a
market with a large number of long horizon agents initially can cause
convergence to the equilibrium which then is relatively impervious to
invasions of short horizon traders. 
</P>
<P>This framework suggests many further explorations both in
calibrating time series, and in policy related examinations of the
heterogeneous agent populations. Basically, it emphasizes the
importance of learning about time and the relevance of how agents use
past data in real financial markets.</P>
