# Short biography for Blake LeBaron

I'm curently a professor at **Brandeis University** in the **International Business School**.

My research and teaching are centered on computational modeling both empirical and theoretical.

My primary contributions are in the development of **agent-based** models for financial markets.  These models
allow for the interactions of many agents in a market, and concentrate on the interactions of their forecasting models.  I have also built **agent-based** models in other areas as well.   A very quick summary is that I'm interested in all areas where outcomes involve the coevolutionary dynamics of populations of predictive models.

I also have been active in time series modeling.  In particular dealing with time series forecasting models for financial markets with a special interest in volatility models.

## Active research projects:

* Simple agent-based microstructure models
* Macroeconomic models with heterogeneous forecasters
* Long range models for volatility/liquidity dynamics
  
## Recent courses taught:

* Machine learning
* Python for business and finance
* Forecasting
* Computational risk modeling
* Advanced asset pricing (Ph.D)

## Computer skills/interests

I'm an active programmer, but try not to be super technical.  I do try to keep up with things that are happening, and I'm very interested in
squeezing the most speed possible from relatively modest hardware.  My skills cover:

* **Python**: (very active)
  * ML tools for Python (Scikit-learn, Keras/tensorflow, numba)
* **Julia**:  (I'm a big fan, and trying to shift code to this platform)
* **Netlogo**: (I use this for some **agent-based** models)
* **Matlab**: (much of my early work uses this)
* **R**: (used for teacing stats/forecasting)
* **Objective-C/C++**: (not very often)
* **Mojo**: (have started looking into this new language)

In terms of software tools, I'm very interested in talking to anyone in the **Julia** community.  I'm hoping it will start to catch on in computational finance/time series work.
