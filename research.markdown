1. **Dynamic Order Dispersion and Volatility Persistence in a Simple
Limit Order Book Model**
  - **Joint with:** Andrew Hawley, Mark Paddrik, and Nathan Palmer
  - **Abstract:** This preliminary paper extends the dynamics of a basic stylized limit
  order book model introduced in \mycite{ChiIor2002}. The
  original model is capable of generating some key market microstructure
  features, but it cannot recreate longer range persistence in volatility.
  We explore a very simple and intuitive addition to the stylized, near
  zero intelligence behavior of traders that is capable of delivering
  persistent volatility. We also show that this strategy depends
  critically on certain key features in the dynamics of supply and demand
  for liquidity and depth in the limit order book. We believe this is
  fundamental to understanding both the dynamics of volatility in
  financial time series, along with variations in liquidity in financial
  markets. We contribute a parsimonious agent-based model to the
  literature that may be used as a test bed or sandbox for developing
  agents with more complex behavior.

2. **Learning Integrated Inflation Forecasts in a Simple Multi-agent Macroeconomic Model**
  - **Joint with:** Karen Smith
  - **Abstract:** This paper implements a model with a population of heterogeneous macro forecasters.  Their
objectives are to forecast output and inflation, both inputs in standard New Keynesian
macro models.  The model is implemented by first calibrating the agents to professional
forecasters at the micro level.  Model runs then try to replicate both the dynamics, bias
and cross sectional heterogeneity of forecasts and the economy.  These are done both
in a model with static forecasters, and one where the forecasters are learning from
each other in a social fashion.
We find that expectations about the inflation process which conjecture near random walk
behavior can be self-fulfilling, yielding inflation volatility and persistence
on the order of magnitude of U.S. macro data.
However, our forecasting
populations often fall short of the heterogeneity of predictions
from survey data.  In some cases, monetary policy can be used to shift the model
from its volatile/persistent equilibrium over to a more stable, strongly mean reverting
inflation rate.

3. **A Century of Market Reversals: Resurrecting Volatility**
  - **Joint with:** Vincent Bogousslavsky and Jeffrey Pontiff
  - **Abstract:** Inventory models posit that return autocorrelation is affected by collateral, volume, and expected volatility. We show that daily market autocorrelations are lower on negative return days, consistent with collateral concerns. Unlike previous literature, we document a strong role of volatility on autocorrelation. Puzzlingly, anticipated volume, not volume shocks, drive reversals. Sparked by these findings, we construct a liquidity risk factor in accordance with Pastor-Stambaugh (2003) that is volatility, not volume, based. The volatility-based factor is more robust and has a higher risk premium than the volume-based factor.
