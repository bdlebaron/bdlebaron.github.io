1. Dynamic Order Dispersion and Volatility Persistence in a Simple
Limit Order Book Model
  - This preliminary paper extends the dynamics of a basic stylized limit
  order book model introduced in \mycite{ChiIor2002}. The
  original model is capable of generating some key market microstructure
  features, but it cannot recreate longer range persistence in volatility.
  We explore a very simple and intuitive addition to the stylized, near
  zero intelligence behavior of traders that is capable of delivering
  persistent volatility. We also show that this strategy depends
  critically on certain key features in the dynamics of supply and demand
  for liquidity and depth in the limit order book. We believe this is
  fundamental to understanding both the dynamics of volatility in
  financial time series, along with variations in liquidity in financial
  markets. We contribute a parsimonious agent-based model to the
  literature that may be used as a test bed or sandbox for developing
  agents with more complex behavior.
